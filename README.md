# RFID Locked Box
## By Andrew Mattson

The goal of my final project was to make a “smart” box with no pickable keyways that still only certain people could access. The solution to this was contactless RFID authentication. The box is 3D printed out of PLA (the STL file is attached to my assignment), and specifically designed to house the components used to lock the box. The components in the box are an Arduino, two LEDs, a speaker, the RFID sensor, a servo, and (I planned to have) a battery.

I ran into a number of issues during the course of my project that compounded toward the end. A few things I would improve in a second version of the box are:
 * 3D print a new box.
   * Route the power cable out the back of the box and not the side.
   * Have holes for the LEDs (so I don’t have to melt new holes).
   * Make a thicker lip on the box’s lid (so it doesn’t break off like last time).
   * Add a hole for the speaker (so it is actually audible).
 * Order boards with holes in them and more labels (to fit the battery and clean things up).
